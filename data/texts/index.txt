	For more than twenty years, the Latin Library has been a labor of love for its maintainer, William L. Carey. For health reasons he has recently passed the maintenance of the library to someone new who will continue it in the same spirit. If the library has enriched you, feel free to drop a note of appreciation to latinlibrary@mac.com. They will be most appreciated.
